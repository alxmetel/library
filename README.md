This is the web-application "Online Library".

It will have this functionality:

- user authorization;
- data editing;
- login and password check;
- data adding;
- multi-language support;
- books search by title and author;
- online book view;
- books downloading;
- session saving;

... and I will continue and edit this list step-by-step.

Creating this application I am going to use these technologies and tools:
JSF, Hibernate, AJAX, Facelets, PrimeFaces, OmniFaces, MySQL and others.


I will update this file step-by-step to show, what has already been used.
